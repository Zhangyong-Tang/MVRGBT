# Revisiting the RGBT Tracking Benchmarks from the Perspective of Modality Validity: A New Benchmark, Problem, and Method

⭐ This main contributions are:

 - [x] A new benchmark, MV-RGBT, and a new way for in-depth analysis of the methods.

 - [x] A new problem, when to fuse, is introduced to explore the necessity of multi-modal fusion.

 - [x] A new method, MoETrack, is derived with a mixture of experts.

 - [x] New state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including MV-RGBT, RGBT234, LasHeR, and VTUAV-ST.

## Benchmark Data Comparison
### ⭐ MV-RGBT will be published after this work accepted!
